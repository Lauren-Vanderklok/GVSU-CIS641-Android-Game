Team name: Android Game

Team members: Lauren Vanderklok, Trey Smith, Anna Kakarala, Sathya Kiran Gandavarapu

# Introduction
The game is to be a 2D top-down adventure with a scavenger hunt type concept.  The plot is that you are an alien whose spaceship crashed on earth and now you need to find the missing pieces of your ship and/or replacement pieces so that you can go home.  By exploring the world, you will find these pieces and other items to help you progress to more areas (potential ideas include:  keys to buildings, a bridge being built, etc).

The game assets are going to be created for the game in Pix2D Pro, a pixel art program that a group member has experience using.  This will be used to create the tilesets for the world and the sprite art for the player, enemies, and npcs.

The game is to be playable on android and will be created in unity.  The current plan for controls is an on-screen gamepad, but that may change if we find that that doesn’t work well or another control method works better.

* C#
* Visual Studio
* Pix2D pro

# Method/Approach

We are planning on doing a basic Agile scrum development approach. We will have 6 sprints, each two weeks, starting september 23rd. At the beginning of each sprint we will have a team meeting to add new stories to the sprint, assign story points, and assign stories to people. 

Each person will have a max of 10 story points per sprint, unless circumstances mean they can't work as much on sprint. We decided to deviate from the standard 8 story point max because we are not working in a standard office environment.. Story points will be estimated by having the story lead describe what they are going to be doing and how difficult it may be. Then people shout out what they believe the story points should be. 

We have planned out what we want for the core of the application, in our timelines and milestones. If we get all of these requirements completed early on, we can move to some stretch goals to add more functionality.

# Anticipated Problems

Anna and Trey need to become familiar with Unity and C# as they have no experience with using them. Lauren has used both before but has not used them in a few years and will need to become familiar again.
