# GVSU-CIS641-Android-Game

 The goal of the project is to create an Android mobile game using Unity software and C# coding.
  The goal of the game is to help the stranded alien find all of the missing pieces of its spaceship
  so that it can return home. The player will need to navigate the 2D landscape, interact with various characters,
  and solve riddles in order to succeed. The group will be using the Agile development method to complete the project. 
  The sprints are spaced out in 2 week intervals, with the group members working to complete 10 story points per sprint.
