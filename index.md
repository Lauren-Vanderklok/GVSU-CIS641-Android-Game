# GVSU-CIS641-Android-Game

 The goal of the project is to create an Android mobile game using Unity software and C# coding.
  The goal of the game is to help the stranded alien find all of the missing pieces of its spaceship
  so that it can return home. The player will need to navigate the 2D landscape, interact with various characters,
  and solve riddles in order to succeed. The group will be using the Agile development method to complete the project. 
  The sprints are spaced out in 2 week intervals, with the group members working to complete 10 story points per sprint.

### Run in Unity

* Install Unity Hub, this is a launcher for managing different versions and extensions for Unity. When you go to work on the project, open it with Unity Hub

To do this open Unity Hub, go to 'Installs' on the side, and click 'ADD' select Unity 2020.3.19f1 (LTS) (note: unity has released a new LTS (long term support) version since we started, so v2020.3.19f1 may not be available anymore. In this case install Unity 2020.3.20f1 (LTS))
* Add Android bulid support to your Unity install. If you have android on your unity install, a small android logo will show up on the bottom of your install on Unity Hub. If you dont see this, click the 3 dots on the top of your unity install, click 'Add Modules' and check 'Android Build Support'
