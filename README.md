To do this open Unity Hub, go to 'Installs' on the side, and click 'ADD' select Unity 2020.3.19f1 (LTS) (note: unity has released a new LTS (long term support) version since we started, so v2020.3.19f1 may not be available anymore. In this case install Unity 2020.3.20f1 (LTS))
* Add Android bulid support to your Unity install. If you have android on your unity install, a small android logo will show up on the bottom of your install on Unity Hub. If you dont see this, click the 3 dots on the top of your unity install, click 'Add Modules' and check 'Android Build Support'
